Open Source & Crowdsourcing
Blitzortung.org is a community of station operators who transmit their data to the central server, programmers who develop software, and people who assist anyway to keep the system running. 


*How good is the accuracy of a located position?*
Depending station density in a region, our accuracy can be better than one kilometer. However, due to computing errors there may be completely false located strikes from time to time.

EUCLID (Paid service)

(EUropean Cooperation for LIghtning Detection) is a collaboration among national lightning detecting networks with the aim to identify and detect lightning all over the European area.
EUCLID archives all the lightning information into a database and can suit any customers need with off line data and can as well provide any kind of post process information, like evaluate the mean number of flashes to ground or to tell how many lightning strokes hit in a particular area at a particular time. Statistical maps and taylored-studies can be provided easily, based on the european wide lightning database.
 ---> SIEMENS BLIDS data is included in the Database
